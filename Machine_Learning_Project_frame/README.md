## Overview 

This Code has been split into the 6 different codes for the assignment. 

Code1_DT
Code2_DT_bin
Code3_PER
Code4_PER_Norm

Each folder should be able to be opened and run independently. 

To run this code, make sure you have added the data with proper naming convention to the folder. That data can be downloaded from https://github.com/hallr384/Machine_learning_final_project under the project_data folder. 


Additionally A full code can be downloaded with all data and all of the results created via my by hand cross validation at the same link under the Machine_Learning_Project_full folder. And this code skeleton will also be included under Machine_Learning_Project_frame
